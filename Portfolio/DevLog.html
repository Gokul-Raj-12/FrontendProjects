    <h3>Welcome to Devlog:</h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: coral;">How The Portfolio Site Works!!!</h2>
    <h3><p style="color: #721112;">Hover over the Projects and scroll to the first page to see a preview of the project :) </p></h3><br><br>
    <h4>This page is for documenting the challenges I faced learning and how I overcame them.</h4>
    <br><br>

    <h3><u>Portfolio Build Process</u></h3>
    <p>I wanted to include a cool loading animation that took me nearly a day to perfect. I did it by elaborate styling, <br>
    use of multiple animations and elaborate container manipulation. I wanted loading animation to look like a screen  <br>
    being lifted. The grid lines are as subtle as they can be can be a statement to the responsive design which the user <br>
    can play with.  </p><br>

    <h3>About Portfolio Alternate:</h3>
    <p>I wanted to emulate the artifact ability introduced in LLM's like Claude and DeepSeekCoderV2 models. <br>
    but I had problems with how to adapt to the mobile resolutions as the artifact part would take up 1/3rd of <br>
    the screen and that would make the site look slightly cluttered. So I took the idea and had to give up on <br>
    replicating it. But I translated that in my current site by combining <i>Inline Frames</i>and <i>Overlay Effects.</i></p><br>
